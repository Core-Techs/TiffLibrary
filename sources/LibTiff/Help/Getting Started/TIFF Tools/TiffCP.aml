                            TiffCP combines one or more files created according to the Tag Image
                            File Format, Revision 6.0 into a single TIFF file. Because the output
                            file may be compressed using a different algorithm than the input
                            files, TiffCP is most often used to convert between different
                            compression schemes.

                            By default, TiffCP will copy all the understood tags in a TIFF
                            directory of an input file to the associated directory in the
                            output file.

                            TiffCP can be used to reorganize the storage characteristics of data
                            in a file, but it is explicitly intended to not alter or convert the
                            image data content in any way.

                                    Subtract the following monochrome image from all others
                                    processed. This can be used to remove a noise bias from a set
                                    of images. This bias image is typically an image of noise the
                                    camera saw with its shutter closed.

                                        compression, <legacyItalic>zip</legacyItalic> for Deflate
                                        compression, <legacyItalic>g3</legacyItalic> for CCITT

                                        for CCITT Group 4 (T.6) compression. By default TiffCP

                                        Group 3 compression can be specified together with several
                                        T.4-specific options: <legacyItalic>1d</legacyItalic> for
                                        1-dimensional encoding, <legacyItalic>2d</legacyItalic>
                                        for 2-dimensional encoding, and
                                        <legacyItalic>fill</legacyItalic> to force each encoded
                                        scanline to be zero-filled so that the terminating EOL
                                        code lies on a byte boundary. Group 3-specific options are
                                        specified by appending a ":"-separated list to the "g3"
                                        option; e.g. <legacyItalic>−c g3:2d:fill</legacyItalic> to
                                        get 2D-encoded data with byte-aligned EOL codes.

                                        LZW compression can be specified together with a predictor
                                        value. A predictor value of 2 causes each scanline of the
                                        output image to undergo horizontal differencing before it
                                        is encoded; a value of 1 forces each scanline to be
                                        encoded without differencing. LZW-specific options are
                                        specified by appending a ":"-separated list to the "lzw"
                                        option; e.g. <legacyItalic>−c lzw:2</legacyItalic> for LZW
                                        compression with horizontal differencing.

                                    Specify the bit fill order to use in writing output data. By
                                    default, TiffCP will create a new file with the same fill
                                    order as the original. Specifying
                                    <legacyItalic>−f lsb2msb</legacyItalic> will force data to be
                                    written with the FillOrder tag set to LSB2MSB, while
                                    <legacyItalic>−f msb2lsb</legacyItalic> will force data to be
                                    written with the FillOrder tag set to MSB2LSB.

                                    Specify the length of a tile (in pixels). TiffCP attempts to
                                    set the tile dimensions so that no more than 8 kilobytes of
                                    data appear in a tile.

                                    overwritten and not when it is appended to.

                                    Specify the planar configuration to use in writing image data
                                    that has one 8-bit sample per pixel. By default, TiffCP will
                                    create a new file with the same planar configuration as the
                                    original. Specifying <legacyItalic>−p contig</legacyItalic>
                                    will force data to be written with multi-sample data packed
                                    together, while <legacyItalic>−p separate</legacyItalic> will
                                    force samples to be written in separate planes.

                                    written to the output file. By default (or when value 0 is
                                    specified), TiffCP attempts to set the rows/strip that no
                                    more than 8 kilobytes of data appear in a strip. If you
                                    specify special value <legacyItalic>−1</legacyItalic> it will
                                    results in infinite number of the rows per strip. The entire
                                    image will be the one strip in that case.

                                    Substitute character for "," in parsing image directory
                                    indices in files. This is necessary if filenames contain
                                    commas. Note that −,= with whitespace immediately following
                                    will disable the special meaning of the "," entirely.

                            The following concatenates two files and writes the result using

                            To convert a G3 1d-encoded TIFF to a single strip of G4-encoded
                            data the following might be used (1000 is just a number that is larger
                            than the number of rows in the source file):

                            To extract a selected set of images from a multi-image TIFF file, the
                            file name may be immediately followed by a "," separated list of image
                            directory indices. The first image is always in directory 0. Thus, to
                            copy the 1st and 3rd images of image file "album.tif" to "result.tif":

                            A trailing comma denotes remaining images in sequence. The following
                            command will copy all image with except the first one:

                            Given file "CCD.tif" whose first image is a noise bias followed by
                            images which include that bias, subtract the noise from all those
                            images following it (while decompressing) with the command:

                            required to correctly parse this filename with image numbers, as
