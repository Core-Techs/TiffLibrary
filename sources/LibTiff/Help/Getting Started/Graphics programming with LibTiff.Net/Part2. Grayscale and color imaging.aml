                This article is the "Graphics programming with libtiff, Part 2. And now for a
                little color" tutorial by Michael Still rewritten to reflect differences between
                libtiff and LibTiff.Net. You can read original article at

                            TIFF is an extremely common but quite complex raster image format.
                            LibTiff.Net, a free managed implementation of the TIFF specification,
                            based on LibTiff, a standard ANSI C implementation. This article
                            shows you how to use LibTiff.Net for grayscale and color imaging.

                            on black and white graphics programming with LibTiff.Net - covers
                            grayscale and color imaging. It assumes that you have read and
                            understand the code from the black and white article. First let's
                            review some theory about how the image data is stored for color
                            and grayscale. This theory applies to all imaging formats. Then we'll
                            cover the specifics of using LibTiff.Net.

                        <para>
                            Images are made up of pixels. In black and white imaging, the pixel
                            has one of two values, 0 or 1. This can be represented in a single
                            bit. For grayscale and color images however, the pixel needs to store
                            a much greater range of values; if a pixel was to have 255 levels of
                            gray, we would need 8 bits to store that pixel. Each of these values
                            is called a sample. TIFF expresses the size of the value in a tag called
                            <codeEntityReference>T:BitMiracle.LibTiff.Classic.TiffTag</codeEntityReference>.BITSPERSAMPLE.
                            This will be 1 for black and white, and some larger number for grayscale.
                        </para>
                        <para>
                            For color images, we need to store even more information. For each
                            pixel we will need to store a red, green, and blue value. Each of
                            these values is stored in a separate <legacyItalic>sample</legacyItalic>.
                            Therefore, we will need to define TiffTag.SAMPLESPERPIXEL. This will
                            be 1 for black and white, or grayscale, but will normally be 3 for
                            color images. We also need to define the size of each sample, so we'll
                            still need to set a value for TiffTag.BITSPERSAMPLE.

                        <para>
                            The first thing we need to understand to be able to support color and
                            grayscale images is the format of the image data within memory. There
                            are two main representations for color and grayscale images. I'll
                            explain these by describing grayscale, and then extend it to color.
                        </para>

                        </para>
                        <para>
                            If you remember the way pixel information was stored in the black
                            and white images from the
                            <link xlink:href="0a42c654-edcb-404a-bbfa-1d50cfad9769">previous article</link>,
                            the information was just in the strips. You can also do this with
                            grayscale and color images, but this representation of image data is
                            quite inefficient. For example, in a scenario in which the image has a
                            solid background, there are many pixels with the same value. If the
                            pixel data is stored in the strips, then this value will waste a large
                            amount of space.
                        </para>
                        <para>
                            Thankfully, there is a more efficient way to store image data. Imagine
                            a simple four-color, 24-bit-per-pixel image. If we build a lookup
                            table of the four color values (the 24-bit values that represent those
                            colors), then we just need to store the relevant entry number of the
                            color in the image strip itself. This can be done in only two bits,
                            instead of the full 24.
                        </para>
                        <para>
                            The math looks something like this: A 24-bit color image that is
                            1,000 by 1,000 pixels will take 24 million bits to store. The same
                            image, if it was a four color image, would take 4 million bits for the
                            strip data, and 98 bits for the color table. Neither of these numbers
                            includes header and footer information for the file format, and the
                            numbers are for uncompressed bitmaps. The advantages of the lookup
                            table are obvious. This style of lookup table is called a
                            <legacyItalic>palette</legacyItalic>, probably because of those things
                            painters carry around.

                        <para>
                            This concept works for grayscale images as well. The only difference
                            is that the "colors" in the palette are just shades of gray.

                                    This entry is here for completeness. If you're coding for
                                    black and white images, then you're probably using the CCITT
                                    fax compression methods. These compression algorithms don't
                                    support color.

                                    JPEG compression is great for large images such as photos.
                                    However, the compression is normally lossy (in that image data
                                    is thrown away as part of the compression process). This makes
                                    JPEG very poor for compressing text which needs to remain
                                    readable. The other thing to bear in mind is that the loss is
                                    cumulative - see the next section for more information
                                    about this.

                                    This is the compression algorithm used in GIF images. There
                                    were the licensing requirements from Unisys, but this
                                    requirements are gone now and this compression codec is useful
                                    for certain types of images. See note below.

                                    PNG. It is the compression algorithm I would recommend for
                                    color images. See note below for another opinion.

                            Why does the loss in lossy compression algorithms such as JPEG
                            accumulate? Imagine that you compress an image using JPEG. You then
                            need to add, say, a barcode to the image, so you uncompress the image,
                            add the barcode, and recompress it. When the recompression occurs, a
                            new set of loss is introduced. You can imagine that if you do this
                            enough, then you'll end up with an image that is a big blob.

                            which is a way of tweaking the loss of the compression algorithm. The
                            lower the quality, the higher the compression ratio. The default is 75%.

                            This code shows some of the things we've discussed in theory. The
                            image has three samples per pixel, each of eight bits. This means that
                            the image is a 24-bit RGB image. If this was a black and white or
                            grayscale image, then this value would be one. The

                            says that the image data is stored within the strips themselves (as
                            opposed to being paletted) - more about this in a minute.

                            The other interesting thing to discuss here is the planar
                            configuration of the image. Here I've specified
                            <codeEntityReference>T:BitMiracle.LibTiff.Classic.PlanarConfig</codeEntityReference>.CONTIG),
                            which means that the red green and blue information for a given pixel
                            is grouped together in the strips of image data. The other option
                            is PlanarConfig.SEPARATE, where the red samples for the image are
                            stored together, then the blue samples, and finally the green samples.

                            In my example, I have three samples per pixel. If this was a black and
                            white image, or a grayscale image, then we would have one sample
                            per pixel.

                            There are other valid values as well; for instance, sometimes people
                            will store a transparency value for a given pixel, an

                            It is possible to have an arbitrary number of samples per pixel, which
                            is good if you need to pack in extra information about a pixel.
                            <legacyItalic>Note that doing this can break image viewers that make
                            silly assumptions - I once had to write code for a former employer to
                            strip out alpha channels and the like so that their PDF generator
                            wouldn't crash.</legacyItalic>

                            So how do we write a paletted version of this image? Well, LibTiff.Net
                            makes this really easy - all we need to do is change the value
                            of TiffTag.PHOTOMETRIC to Photometric.PALETTE. It's not really worth
                            including an example in this article, given it's a one word change.

                        <para>
                            Now all we have to do is work out how to read other people's color
                            and grayscale images reliably, and we're home free. Initially, I was
                            very tempted to gloss over the
                            <codeEntityReference>M:BitMiracle.LibTiff.Classic.Tiff.ReadRGBAStrip(System.Int32,System.Int32[])</codeEntityReference>
                            and
                            <codeEntityReference>M:BitMiracle.LibTiff.Classic.Tiff.ReadRGBATile(System.Int32,System.Int32,System.Int32[])</codeEntityReference>
                            calls, which hide some of the potential ugliness from the caller.
                            However, these functions have some limitations, which are expressed
                            in the documentation for
                            <codeEntityReference>M:BitMiracle.LibTiff.Classic.Tiff.ReadRGBAStrip(System.Int32,System.Int32[])</codeEntityReference>
                        </para>
                        <para>
                            There are a couple of odd things about this function. First, it
                            defines (0, 0) to be in a different location than all the other code
                            that we have been writing. In the previous code, the (0, 0) point has
                            been in the top left of the image. This call defines (0, 0) to be in
                            the bottom left. The other limitation is that not all valid values for
                            bits per sample are supported. If you find these quirks unacceptable,
                            then remember that you can still use
                            <codeEntityReference>M:BitMiracle.LibTiff.Classic.Tiff.ReadEncodedStrip(System.Int32,System.Byte[],System.Int32,System.Int32)</codeEntityReference>
                            in the same manner that I did for the black and white images in the
                            previous article.

                            Well, now that we've covered reading and writing basically any image
                            format we can think of, there are two final topics.

                            All the examples to this point have read and written with files. There
                            are many scenarios in which you wouldn't want to store your image data
                            in a file, but would still want to use LibTiff.Net and TIFF. For
                            example, you might have customer pictures for id cards, and these
                            would be stored in a database.

                            The example I am most familiar with is PDF documents, where you can
                            embed images into the document. These images can be in a subset of
                            TIFF if desired, and TIFF is clearly the choice for black and
                            white images.

                            LibTiff.Net allows you to replace the file/stream input and output
                            functions in the library with your own. This is done with the

                            How do you convert color images to grayscale? My first answer was to
                            just average the red, green, and blue values. That answer is wrong.
                            The reality is that the human eye is much better at seeing some colors
                            than others. To get an accurate grayscale representation, you need to
                            apply different coefficients to the color samples. Appropriate
                            coefficients are 0.299 for red, 0.587 for green, and 0.114 for blue.

                            In this article I've discussed how to program with LibTiff.Net for
                            grayscale and color images. I've shown you some sample code that
                            should help to get you started. You should now know enough to have a
                            great time coding with LibTiff.Net.
